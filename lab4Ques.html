        <h2>Stratovolcanos</h2>
        <div>
            <P>
                A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano 
                built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava and tephra.[1] Unlike 
                shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile 
                with a summit crater and periodic intervals of explosive eruptions and 
                effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed summit craters called 
                calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens 
                before spreading far, due to high viscosity.

            <p>The magma forming this lava is often felsic, 
                having high-to-intermediate levels of silica 
                (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of 
                less-viscous mafic magma.[2] Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, 
                but have travelled as far as 15 km (9 mi).[3]</p>
                <p>Stratovolcanoes are sometimes called composite volcanoes because of 
                    their composite stratified structure, built up from sequential outpourings 
                    of erupted materials. They are among the most common types of volcanoes, in 
                    contrast to the less common shield volcanoes.[4] Two famous examples of 
                    stratovolcanoes are Krakatoa in Indonesia, known for its catastrophic 
                    eruption in 1883, and Vesuvius in Italy, whose catastrophic eruption in 
                    AD 79 buried the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Both eruptions 
                    claimed thousands of lives. In modern times, Mount St. Helens in Washington 
                    State, USA and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines have erupted catastrophically, 
                    but with fewer deaths. Stratovolcanoes are common at subduction zones, forming chains and clusters along plate tectonic boundaries where oceanic crust is drawn under continental crust (continental arc volcanism, e.g. Cascade Range, Andes, Campania) or another oceanic plate (island arc volcanism, e.g. Japan, Philippines, Aleutian Islands). The magma forming stratovolcanoes rises when water trapped both in hydrated minerals and in the porous basalt rock of the upper oceanic crust is released into mantle rock of the asthenosphere above the sinking oceanic slab.[7] The release of water from hydrated minerals is termed "dewatering", and occurs at specific pressures and temperatures for each mineral, as the plate descends to greater depths.[8] The water freed from the rock lowers the melting point of the overlying mantle rock, which then undergoes partial melting.</p>

            <p>The release of water from hydrated minerals is termed "dewatering", and occurs at specific pressures and temperatures for each mineral, as the plate descends to greater depths.[8] The water freed from the rock lowers the melting point of the overlying mantle rock, which then undergoes partial melting and rises due to its lighter density relative to the surrounding mantle rock, and pools temporarily at the base of the lithosphere. The magma then rises through the crust, incorporating silica-rich crustal rock, leading to a final intermediate 
                composition. 
                When the magma nears the top surface, 
                it pools in a magma chamber within the crust below the stratovolcano.[7] These internal triggers may be modified by external triggers such as sector collapse, earthquakes, or interactions with groundwater. Some of these triggers operate only under limited conditions.</p>
